# Games in R
I've always wondered why there are so few games in R.

Just copy and paste the code directly in R. Enjoy playing the first 3D maze game with real monsters or the beautiful game "Bulls and Cows" in R !

# If needed, here is a procedure explaining how to play the game Maze3D in R.

1. Source the "mazeR.R" file in R.

2. Wait to see the level numbers, a sword and colours.

3. Choose the colours you want for the final object.

3. Click on the level number you are at. This will lead you in the game.

4. In the 3D maze, click on the black arrows below the screen in order to go through the maze.

5. Find the keys or maps and click on them to put them in your inventory.

6. Find the door or other objects related to the items you found. After that, click on the objects in order to complete each level.

7. Have fun !
